# XignCode Bypasser installer for Blade &amp; Soul

This allows you to install the XignCode Bypasser easily, without having to navigate all over the folders.
If your system is 32 bits, it will ask you if you want to skip installing the 64 bits version, to reduce the work needed.

Since this copies the files (instead of moving), applying the XignCode Bypasser later on doesn't require re-downloading the files.

## Requirements
- Make sure the game is installed in a path existing in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\NCWest\BnS` (value `BaseDir`)
- Make sure it is NOT in a network shared folder! **IT WON'T WORK!**
- Make sure you can have Administrator (Windows Vista and up) access before you try to run this code.

## How to use?

1. Download the XignCode Bypasser (skip to step 3 if you alreade have the files extracted)
    (Available in the BnS Buddy Discord server, in the `#download` channel)
2. Extract the compressed file
3. Place the `install.bat` file in the extracted folder
    Placing the file anywhere else **won't work**!
4. Right-click and click on "Run as Administrator" (or similar for your language)
5. Enjoy the game!

## How to revert?

Do a file repair (after you login)

# Disclaimer

I guarantee that the file works for me and me only. Different environment may behave differently.

This will **NOT** work if the game is being executed from a custom path. The path **must** be in the registry key.

I am **NOT** responsible for **ANY** damage or data loss from using this. **You are the only responsible for making your own backups**, if you want to do so.

Before installing, **YOU are responsible** for checking if the game installation path is correct.
