# XignCode Bypasser installer for Blade &amp; Soul

This allows you to install the XignCode Bypasser easily.

## Requirements
- Make sure the game is installed in a path existing in the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\NCWest\BnS` (value `BaseDir`)
- Make sure it is NOT in a network shared folder! **IT WON'T WORK!**

1. Download the XignCode Bypasser
    (Available in the BnS Buddy Discord server, in the `#download` channel)
2. Extract the compressed file
3. Place the `install.bat` file in the extracted folder
    Placing the file anywhere else **won't work**!
4. Right-click and click on "Run as Administrator" (or similar for your language)
5. Enjoy the game!

# Disclaimer

I guarantee that the file works for me and me only. Different environment may behave differently.

This will **NOT** work if the game is being executed from a custom path. The path **must** be in the registry key.

I am **NOT** responsible for **ANY** damage or data loss from using this. You are the only responsible for making your own backups, if you want to do so.
