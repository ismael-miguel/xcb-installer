# XignCode Bypasser installer for Blade &amp; Soul

This allows you to install the XignCode Bypasser easily, without having to navigate all over the folders.
If your system is 32 bits, it will skip installing the 64 bits version, to reduce the work needed.

Since this copies the files (instead of moving), applying the XignCode Bypasser later on doesn't require re-downloading the files.

## Requirements
- Make sure it is ***NOT*** in a network shared folder! **IT WON'T WORK!**
- Make sure you can have Administrator access (Windows Vista and up) before you try to run this code.
- Make sure the game is closed completely.
- To make it easier in the future, make sure the game is installed in a path existing in the registry keys:
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\NCWest\BnS` (value `BaseDir`) for 32-bit Windows
    - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\NCWest\BnS` (value `BaseDir`) for 64-bit Windows

## How to use?

1. Download the XignCode Bypasser
    (Available in the BnS Buddy Discord server, in the `#download` channel)
2. Download the `install.bat` file
3. (Optional, but recommended) Place the `install.bat` file inside the Xigncode Bypasser folder
4. Right-click and click on "Run as Administrator" (or similar for your language)
5. If you skipped step 3, press E to extract a ZIP file or B to select the Xigncode Bypasser folder
6. Enjoy the game!

## How to revert?

Do a file repair (after you login)

# Disclaimer

I guarantee that the file works for me and me only. Different environment may behave differently.

This will **NOT** work if the game is being executed from a custom path. The path **must** be in the registry key.

I am **NOT** responsible for **ANY** damage or data loss from using this. **You are the only responsible for making your own backups**, if you want to do so.

Before installing, **YOU are responsible** for checking if the game installation path is correct.
